1. To create 2 networks
 
  docker network create network1
 
  docker network create network2
 

2. To see the list of networks 
 
  
   docker network ls
 
3. start busybox b1 container on network1
 

  docker run -it --name b1 --network network1 busybox
 
   Ctrlp+Ctrlq
 
4. find the IP adress of the b1
 
   docker inspect b1
 
5. start busybox b2 container on network1
 

  docker run -it --name b2 --network network1 busybox
 
6. start busybox b3 container on network2
 
  docker run -it --name b3 --network network2 busybox
 
7. connect container2 (b2) to network2
 
  docker network connect network2 b2
 
8. Go into container 2 (b2)
 
  docker attach container 2
 
9. from b2 to ping ipaddress of container 1 (b1)
 
   it should communicate ( because contianer 1 and container 2 are sharing the same network i.e., network 1)
 

10. from b2 to ping ipaddress of container 3 (b3)
 
   it should communicate ( because contianer 2 and container 3 are sharing the same network i.e., network 2)
 
11. But if we call container 1 from container 3 and viseversa ., call should not happen
 
    because container1 and container 3 are sharing different networks
 
   i.e., container 1 is available in network1
 
   and 
 
         container 3 is available in network2
